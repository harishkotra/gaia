## Installation

To install the `gaia` package globally, run:

```bash
npm install -g gaia
```

## Usage

To start a Gaia node with the default model configuration, run:

```bash
gaia
```

To use a custom model configuration, provide the URL to the configuration file using the `--model` flag:

```bash
gaia --model https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/main/llama-3.2-3b-instruct/config.json
```

## Usage

You can also use the `initGaiaNode` function programmatically in your Node.js or TypeScript projects:

```bash
const { initGaiaNode } = require('gaia');

// URL to the model configuration JSON
const modelConfigUrl = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs/main/llama-3.2-3b-instruct/config.json';

// Initialize and start the Gaia node
initGaiaNode(modelConfigUrl)
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Gaia node setup completed successfully.');
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Failed to set up Gaia node:', error);
  });
```

## Example Use Cases

1. AI Chatbots:
    - Use Gaia to deploy a Gaia node as the backend for an AI-powered chatbot.
2. Knowledge Bases:
    - Set up a Gaia node to serve as a knowledge base for your application.
3. AI-Powered APIs:
    - Use Gaia nodes as drop-in replacements for OpenAI APIs in your applications.
4. Research and Development:
    - Quickly spin up Gaia nodes for testing and experimentation with different AI models.

## Security Considerations

Gaia is designed with security in mind:
- **URL Validation:** Ensures that the model configuration URL points to a trusted domain.
- **Secure Command Execution:** Uses `child_process.execFile` to prevent shell injection vulnerabilities.
- **Error Handling:** Logs errors without exposing sensitive information.
